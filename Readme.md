# Code for Photon Number Resolving mode of the detector ID281-SYS-4D using an oscilloscope

For using the detector we need to characterize the efficiencies. The description of how to do that is shown in the paper [Fast High-Efficiency Photon-Number-Resolving Parallel Superconducting
Nanowire Single-Photon Detector](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.064041). 

We aim to reconstruct P.
